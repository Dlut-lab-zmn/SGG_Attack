We implement the basic iterative method, the projected gradient decent method, the sparse attack, the patch attack, the fast gradient sign method,the momentum-based method, etc.
Please see details in gradient_attack.py.

For attacking the object detection, 5 phases (each phase contains 10 iterations) are adopted with the initial epsilon to 0.1 and the stride of epsilon to 0.2.
At the beginning of each phase, we increase the value of eposilon.

For attacking the SGG, 5 phases (each phase contains 20 iterations) are adopted with the initial epsilon to 0.1 and the stride of epsilon to 0.2.
At the beginning of each phase, we increase the value of eposilon.
